        <h1>Font</h1>
        <p>In CSS, there are two types of font family names:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>generic family: </b>a group of font families with a similar look (ex: Serif)</li>
            <li><b>font family: </b>a specific font family (ex: "Times New Roman" or Arial)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The font-family property should hold several font names as a fallback in case the browser doesn't support the first font you picked. <br /> Always start with the font you want and end witha  generic family. Also, if the font family is more than one word, it must be in <br /> quotation marks (ex: "Times New Roman"). </p>
