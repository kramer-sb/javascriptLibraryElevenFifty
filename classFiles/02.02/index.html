    <h1><u>Learning Code</u></h1>
    <h2>I learn coding best first by watching Mr. T's videos and taking notes.</h2>
    <h2>I think then watching the videos and doing the code-alongs are the next best help. </h2>

    <h1><u>Struggles</u></h1>
    <h3>I think the hardest thing is learning to think about code in a different way - I feel like I miss some connections. For example, I totally missed that '${}' isn't just used in objects until looking at a video for the second time. I need to remember that sometimes brackets and curlie braces are used for things other than arrays and objects, respectively.</h3>
    <h3>The second biggest thing is still just trying to get into a rhythm with all of it, the balancing of work, school, and family. That will continue to improve as time goes by, but it is still a bit of a struggle.  </h3>
